/*
    This is the cpp file which actually runs all the code from the Gameplay class to create a terminal based game
    -this is a sort of stock market simulator game
    -each turn, the player is preseted with a list of companies and their attributes
    -they can choose to buy or sell shares in those companies, keeping in mind that their profit is determined by probability
    -sometimes, strange events will happen that completetely change how certain companies make money, watch out for those
    -at the end of the game, you win by having more money than you started with
